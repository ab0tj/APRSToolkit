PiCrumbsPsk: A command line PSK63 encoder.

The PiCurumbs 'psk' program takes text input from stdin and converts it to raw
8-bit, 8 KHz audio samples on stdout. Currently it only takes one command line
argument: the PSK audio carrier frequency in Hz.

Example:
echo "AB0TJ Test PSK63 beacon" | ./psk 1000 | aplay

It will be built along side PiCrumbs with the "make" command, or you can build
it seperately by typing "make psk".
