PiCrumbs, Alpha version 0.1

DESCRIPTION:

An intelligent APRS tracker for Linux. I created this for my own personal use
but I welcome outside use and/or contributions. The idea was to create the most
robust tracker possible for my offroad adventures, where someone knowing where you
are could mean the difference between life and death in an emergency.

PiCrumbs was created for a Raspberry Pi and soundmodem combo. It should work fine
on any Linux system and with any KISS TNCs. It has support for VHF (1200 baud),
HF (300 baud), VHF satellite, and HTTP internet beaconing. It works from a user
defined list of paths to try sending a packet. If it "thinks" it was not successful
in sending a packet, it will try again or move on to the next path, depending on
the settings provided by the user. It will automatically tune any radio supported
by Hamlib.

Determination of success or failure on VHF channels is based on the tracker
"hearing" its packets being repeated by a digipeater. This is not a perfect way to
determine if the packet got through, as mobile packet reception can be flaky.
Therefore, the tracker MUST be used with a radio that has a receiver if you want
to use the frequency hopping features. For the same reason, it is recommended you
don't use the VHF APRS channel too agressively as you may annoy your fellow hams.
HF channel usage should be a last resort only, and should be used sparingly.

USAGE:

Type "make" to build PiCrumbs. libhamlib-dev, libhamlib++-dev and wiringPi
are required.

See picrumbs.conf.example for how to configure PiCrumbs. Your modified config
file should be saved to /etc/picrumbs.conf

PiCrumbs needs to have access to all the files you specify in the config file.
Change permissions as necessary or run it as root.
